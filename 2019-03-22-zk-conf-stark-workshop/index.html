### Purpose of this workshop

To go through the STARK protocol, so that later when reading the paper more of it is approachable.

Additionally there is an accompanying paper that works out all the intermediate steps.

-----
## What is verified computation
---
### Properties

Prove that  computation is correct without having to recompute it.

- Completeness: an honest prover should be able to convince the verifier
- Soundness: a dishonest prover should not, with a high probability, be able to convince the verifier

As an extension

- Zero-Knowledge: the verifier learns nothing about any auxilary (secret) inputs the prover used to create the proof

-----
## What is a ZK-STARK
---
### Core attributes

- ZK: zero knowledge; private inputs are shielded
- Scalable: generating a proof of computation lasting T cycles
  * proof generated in roughly T cycles (quasi-linear T)
  * verified exponentially faster than T (roughly `log(T)` cycles)
    * log is important (`log(10^6) = 13`, `log(10^9) = 20`)
- Transparent: verifiers messages are only public random coins (interactive) OR use of a collision resistant hash function (non-interactive)
  * no trusted setup
- ARgument of Knowledge: proof can be generated only by party knowing private data

-----
## What is a ZK-STARK
---
### Asymptotic Complexity

**Prover time**

`\mathcal{O}(N\cdot log(N))`

**Proof size**

`\mathcal{O}(N\cdot log^2(N))`

**Round complexity**

`\mathcal{O}(log(N))`

-----
## What is a ZK-STARK
---
### Compared to ZK-SNARK

##### STARK

- can work over any algebraic domain
- binary fields, or prime fields (any Galois field)
- post-quantum secure (relies on information theoretic assumptions only)

##### SNARK & Bulletproof

- based on number theoretic assumptions
- you must work in a specific prime field, with elliptic curve pairing
- elliptic curve math is vunerable to quantum algorithms solving the discrete logarithm problem

-----
## What is a ZK-STARK
---
### Virtues of Transparency

- eliminates single point of failure as there is no trusted setup
- allows for continuous deployment of minor upgrades, since no ceremony is required to upgrade

-----
## What we will do today
---
### Overview of STARK protocol pipeline
![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-overview.svg)

- pen and paper
- use online Galois (finite field) calculator

## Math warmup
---
### Polynomials - Degree

Polynomials are a formal sum of exponents, with coefficient from the chosen field.

The degree is the maximal non-zero term

- `5x + 1`, is degree 1
  * coefficient is 5 and 1
- `x^2 + 3x + 7`, is degree 2
  * coefficients are 1, 3, and 7

-----
## Math warmup
---
### Polynomials - Lookup Tables

- polynomials are like a program where you plug in `x` and get out some value `v`
- can have lookup tables of precomputed values for such a function
- function is degree `d`, if it is an evaluation of a polynomial with degree `d`

-----
## Math warmup
---
### Binary fields - `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

All the arithmetic we will do for our STARK example happens in a finite field.

We need a large enough finite field to work in, and computing a lookup table for `2^{16}` is not so fun, nor is doing all the multiplication by hand.

This is also called a characteristic 2 finite field, with 65536 elements (`2^{16} = 65536`).

Pen and paper.. and one digital tool.
Calculator: https://bit.ly/2Cn5IpE

-----
## Math warmup
---
### Binary fields - `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

**Attention:**

If you are familiar with computations in a prime field `\mathbb{F}_{q}` for a prime number `q`, keep in mind that computations in `\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}` are different and NOT derived from ordinary integer computation "modulo `2^{n}`".

-----
## Math warmup
---
### Binary fields - Generator in `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

We assume a generator `t` in `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}` so that we can write any element `x \in \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}` with coefficients `\lambda_0,...,\lambda_{15} \in \{0,1\}`

#### `x = \lambda_{15}t^{15} + \lambda_{14}t^{14} + ... + \lambda_{1}t^{1} + \lambda_{0}`

As a consequence elements `x \in \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}` can be represented as 16-bit binary strings `x = \langle\lambda_0,...,\lambda_{15}\rangle` or as a number between 0 and 65536.

We have chosen the monomial of degree one as our generator for this example, and call it `t`

A generator is an element that can generate all other elements of the group by multiplication with itself. ie. `t^{257} = 256`

We will introduce Reed-Solomon codes before the APR step, but for now this is all we need!

-----
## Notation used
---

`x` is used exclusively for elements of our Galois field `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

`t` is a constant for the STARK protocol; when used in computations it is a polynomial in `\mathbb{F}_{2}[t]`

## STARK example for Fibonnaci
---
### Definition of Fibonnaci sequence

Lets compute some values of the Fibonnaci sequence starting with {0, 1}.

We compute the n-th number in the sequence like: `F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}`

```
\begin{bmatrix}
F_0 & | & 0\\
F_1 & | & 1\\
F_2 & | & 1\\
F_3 & | & 2\\
\end{bmatrix}
```

-----
## STARK example for Fibonnaci
---
### Definition of Fibonnaci sequence

However the term “number” here does not mean an ordinary number like an integer, but an element from our finite field.

```
\begin{bmatrix}
F_0 & | & 0\\
F_1 & | & 1\\
F_2 & | & 1\\
F_3 & | & 0\\
\end{bmatrix}
```

-----
## STARK example for Fibonnaci

### Definition of Fibonnaci sequence

To better represent that, remember that we can write the 16 digit binary string as a reminder that we are using elements in a finite field.

```
\begin{bmatrix}
F_0 & | & \langle0000000000000000\rangle\\
F_1 & | & \langle0000000000000001\rangle\\
F_2 & | & \langle0000000000000001\rangle\\
F_3 & | & \langle0000000000000000\rangle\\
\end{bmatrix}
```

### What are we doing

![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-overview.svg)

We are essentially a compiler, where each step is performing some transformation from one represensation to another, until the final step is "FRI friendly" as this is the final step.

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-AIR.svg)

- show our computation as an execution trace, with algebraic registers
- create polynomial contraints
- define the instance and witness as a BAIR

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
First step is to write our computation as an "algebraic execution trace" of the program running for `T` steps.

This is represented by a `w \times T` array in which each entry is an element of a finite field.

Each row describes the state of the computation at a certain step in time `T`, and a single column tracks a "register" over each time step.
</div>
<div id="nexte-3" class="katex-center step markdown">
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Variables

Our Fibonacci sequence has two registers, and it can run a maximum of 3 steps.

* T is an integer representing a bound on running time
* w is an integer representing state width

`T = 3`
`w = 2`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Execution Trace

For our example, when given the inputs
`(\langle1001011011101110\rangle, \langle1111010010101011\rangle)`

a correct algebraic execution trace of our computation looks like:

```
\begin{bmatrix}
\langle1001011011101110\rangle & | & \langle1111010010101011\rangle\\
\langle1111010010101011\rangle & | & \langle0110001001000101\rangle\\
\langle0110001001000101\rangle & | & \langle1001011011101110\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
```

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Execution Trace - fraudulent

To give an example of an incorrect execution trace we consider the same input
values `(\langle1001011011101110\rangle, \langle1111010010101011\rangle)`
and cheat by writing the execution trace as:

```
\begin{bmatrix}
\langle1001011011101110\rangle & | & \langle1111010010101011\rangle\\
\langle1111111100000000\rangle & | & \langle0000000011111111\rangle\\
\langle1010101010101010\rangle & | & \langle0101010101010101\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
```

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Monotone Boolean Circuit C

The reason monotone circuits are used, as opposed to general circuit which are more expressive is that adding negation gates to the boolean circuit may:

- destroy perfect completeness
- reduce efficiency
- or require more rounds of interaction (depending on the way negation gates are arithmetized)

This means you can only use AND / OR gates to build the circuit.

------

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Definition of the AIR instance

In the following we will compute the required parts (P, B)
  * we did not need the C for this example, so did not build the circuit
`\mathbb{X} = (\mathbb{F_{2^{16}}}, 3, 2, \mathcal{P}, C, B)`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Constraint Checking Polynomials

Now that we have our algebraic execution trace, we can derive the BAIR representation of our example.

To do this we first have to represent our computation as a set of polynomials `P(x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2)`.

We will use the register `x_i` for registers in the current time step, and `y_i` for registers in the next step.

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Constraint Checking Polynomials (inputs)

`P_1(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = x_{r_1} - a`

(Register one begins with the value from input "a")

`P_2(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = x_{r_2} - b`

(Register two begins with the value from input "b")

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Constraint Checking Polynomials (computation)

`P_3(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = y_{r_2} - (x_{r_1} + x_{r_2})`

(In each step, register two is the sum from registers one and two from previous step)

`P_4(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = y_{r_1} - x_{r_2}`

(In each step, register two is moved into register one of the next step)

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Constraint Checking Polynomials

- the higher degree the polynomial constraints are, the larger proof size will be and the longer it takes to generate
- we are the best case here having linear contraints (degree one)

Altogether the set of polynomials `\mathcal{P}=\{P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}\}`
represents the computational integrity statement.

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Constraint Checking Polynomials

`\mathcal{P}=\begin{Bmatrix}\\
P_1(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = x_{r_1} - a\\
P_2(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = x_{r_2} - b\\
P_3(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = y_{r_2} - (x_{r_1} + x_{r_2})\\
P_4(x_{r_1}, x_{r_2}, y_{r_1}, y_{r_2}) = y_{r_1} - x_{r_2}\\
\end{Bmatrix}`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Boundary Constraints

The set of boundary constraints B represents the algebraic execution trace, where each boundary constraint is a tuple.
`(i, j, \alpha)`

#### for

`i\in\ [T]`
`j\in\ [w]`
`\alpha\ in\ \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Boundary Constraints

The set of boundary constraints is then:
`B=\{(1,1,a),(1,2,b),(2,1,b),(2,2,a+b),(3,1,a+b),(3,2,a+b+b)\}`

</div>
<div id="nexte-4" class="step markdown">
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Instance definition

We call the instance `\mathbb{X}` a `(n,t,d)-BAIR`

For us this means `(16,2,1)-BAIR`

Where the instance is the tuple `\mathbb{X} = (\mathbb{F_{2^{16}}}, T, w, \mathcal{P}, C, B)`

For us this means `\mathbb{X} = (\mathbb{F_{2^{16}}}, 3, 2, \mathcal{P}, C, B)`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Instance definition

We now have everything for our instance

`\mathbb{X} = \begin{bmatrix} (\mathbb{F_{2^{16}}}, 3, 2, \mathcal{P}, C, B)\end{bmatrix}`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Witness definition

The witness is a set of functions `\mathbb{W} = \{w_1, ..., w_w\}: [T] \to \mathbb{F}`

where the witness satisfies the instance `\mathbb{X}` exactly if:

for all boundary constraints `(i, j, \alpha)` we have `w_j(i) = \alpha`

for all `t \in [T-1]` we have
#### `C(IsZeros(\mathcal{P}(w[t], w[t + 1]))) = TRUE`

where `w[t] = (w_1(t),...,w_w(t))`

and `IsZero : \mathbb{F}^k \to \{TRUE, FALSE\}^k` is the mapping that sends `0 \in \mathbb{F}` to TRUE and all non-zero elements to FALSE

</div>
<div id="nexte-5" class="katex-center step markdown">
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Witness defintion

In our example an execution trace is a witness exactly if

```
\mathbb{W}=\begin{bmatrix}
a & | & b\\
b & | & a+b\\
a+b & | & a+b+b
\end{bmatrix}
```

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Witness defintion

Our example from before:

```
\mathbb{W}_{right}=\begin{bmatrix}
\langle1001011011101110\rangle & | & \langle1111010010101011\rangle\\
\langle1111010010101011\rangle & | & \langle0110001001000101\rangle\\
\langle0110001001000101\rangle & | & \langle1001011011101110\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
```

This represents a correct witness, therefore `(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{W}_{right}) \in L_{BAIR}` is a `(16,2,1)-BAIR`

-----
## Algebraic Intermediate Representation (AIR)
---
### Witness defintion - fraudulent

Our incorrect example from before:

```
\mathbb{W}_{wrong}=\begin{bmatrix}
\langle1001011011101110\rangle & | & \langle1111010010101011\rangle\\
\langle1111010010101011\rangle & | & \langle0110001001000101\rangle\\
\langle0110001001000101\rangle & | & \langle1001011011101110\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
```

This is a fraud, therefore `(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{W}_{wrong}) \not\in L_{BAIR}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-APR.svg)

The point of the APR is transform the AIR into functions that are Reed-Solomon codes if and only if the execution trace is a witness.

This is done in a way most useful for the FRI protocol.

The instance `\mathbb{X} = (\mathbb{F}, \mathcal{T}, \mathcal{N}, \Phi, \mathbb{L}, \mathbb{L}_{cmp}, (\rho_1, \rho_2), \rho_{cmp})`

`=\{1,2\}`

## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)

#### Overview

The purpose of the following it
`W: L \to \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

W is a Reed-Solomon code (if the data we actually use is an actual BAIR-pair `(\mathbb{x}, \mathbb{w})`)

L is the domain of W

We being by computing L and some other affine subspaces in our finite field.

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Primitive Polynomial

We start with the definition of the polynomial

#### `\xi(t):= t^2 + t + 1`

which is a primitive polynomial of degree 2.

It is primitive as `\mathbb{F}_{2^{2}}` can be generated from `\xi`

It is also an element of `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}` as the its degree is less than the field we are using (2 < 16).

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### `H \subset \mathbb{F}`

This is the space `Span_{\mathbb{F}_2}(\{t^k | 0 <= k < t'\})`

`H = \{\lambda_1t + \lambda_0 | \lambda_1, \lambda_0 \in \mathbb{F}_2\}`

`H = \{\langle00000000000000\lambda_10\rangle + \langle000000000000000\lambda_0\rangle\}`

```
H = \begin{Bmatrix}
\langle0000000000000000\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000001\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000010\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000011\rangle
\end{Bmatrix}
```

`H = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### `H_0 \subset H`

This is the subspace spanned by `\{t^k\ |\ 0 <= k < t'-1\}`

`H_0 = \{\lambda_0 | \lambda_0 \in \mathbb{F}_2\}`

`H_0 = \{\langle000000000000000\lambda_0\rangle\}`

```
H_0 = \begin{Bmatrix}
\langle0000000000000000\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000001\rangle\\
\end{Bmatrix}
```

`H_0 = \{0, 1\}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### `H_1 \subset H`

This is the affine space `H_1 \triangleq H_0 + t^{t'-1}`

```
H_1 = \begin{Bmatrix}
\langle0000000000000000\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000001\rangle\\
\end{Bmatrix}
+ \langle0000000000000010\rangle
```

```
H_1 = \begin{Bmatrix}
\langle0000000000000010\rangle\\
\langle0000000000000011\rangle\\
\end{Bmatrix}
```

`H_1 = \{2, 3\}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Affine subspace `L` and `L_{cmp}`

```
L=Span_{\mathbb{F}_{2}}(\{t^{8}\cdot(1+t)\}\cup\{t^{0},...,t^{7}\})+t^{8} =\\
\{\langle000000\lambda_{8}(1-\lambda_{8})\lambda_{7}\lambda_{6}\lambda_{5}\lambda_{4}\lambda_{3}\lambda_{2}\lambda_{1}\lambda_{0}\rangle|\lambda_{0},...,\lambda_{8}\in\{0,1\}\}
```

In particular we can see that, as a set, `L` contains `2^{9}=512`
elements, as there are `9` free parameters in the definition, each
from `\mathbb{F}_{2}`. This is important for the Reed Solomon codes.
Written in base10 we see `L` as the set of numbers:
`L=\{256,\ldots,767\}`

```
L_{cmp}=Span_{\mathbb{F}_{2}}(\{t^{0},...,t^{7}\})+t^{8} =\\
\{\langle00000001\lambda_{7}\lambda_{6}\lambda_{5}\lambda_{4}\lambda_{3}\lambda_{2}\lambda_{1}\lambda_{0}\rangle|\lambda_{0},...,\lambda_{7}\in\{0,1\}\}
```

The set `L_{cmp}` contains `2^{8}=256` elements for the same reason. Written in base10 we get `L_{cmp}` as the set of numbers:
`L_{cmp}=\{256,\ldots,511\}`

#### Polynomials `Z_{B,j}` and `\mathcal{E}_{B,j}`

For every `j \in [w]` we define `Z_{B,j}, \mathcal{E}_{B,j} \in \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}[x]`

`Z_{B,j}(x) \triangleq\Pi_{(i,j,\alpha)}(x-t^{i}\%\xi(t))`

`(i, j, \alpha) \in B, \mathcal{E}_{B,j}(t^i \% \xi(t)) = \alpha`

Next we compute the Polynomials `Z_{B,j}` and `\mathcal{E}_{B,j}` for `j\in\{1,2\}`.

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Polynomials `Z_{B,j}`

We do one example computation here, which can be done for the other `Z_{B,j}`

##### `Z_{B,1}(x) =\Pi_{(i,1,\alpha)}(x-t^{i}\%\xi(t))`
##### ` =\Pi_{(i,1,\alpha)}(x-t^{i}\%(t^{2}+t+1))`
##### ` =(x-t)\cdot(x-(t+1))\cdot(x-1)`
##### ` =(x+t)\cdot(x+t+1)\cdot(x+1)`
##### ` =(x+2)\cdot(x+3)\cdot(x+1)`
##### ` =(x^{2}+(2+3)x+6)\cdot(x+1)`
##### ` =(x^{2}+x+6)\cdot(x+1)`
##### ` =x^{3}+x^{2}+6x+x^{2}+x+6`
##### ` =x^{3}+7x+6`

By construction, this polynomial only has roots in `H`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Polynomials `Z_{B,j}`

Since the definition does not depend on `j` the expression for is the same for both `Z_{B,1}` and `Z_{B,2}`

`Z_{B,j} = x^{3}+7x+6`

#### Solving system of equations for register one

`\mathcal{E}_{B,j}` is the polynomial of minimal degree such that for every

#### `(i, j, \alpha) \in B, \mathcal{E}_{B,j}(t^i \% \xi(t)) = \alpha`

For "tracking the first register"

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(t^1\%(t^2 + t + 1)) = a`

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(t^2\%(t^2 + t + 1)) = b`

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(t^3\%(t^2 + t + 1)) = a + b`

#### Solving system of equations for register one

In a similar process to computing the `Z(x)`'s we get

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(\langle0000000000000010\rangle) = a`

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(\langle0000000000000011\rangle) = b`

`\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(\langle0000000000000001\rangle) = a + b`

This is exactly the same as the first register of a correct execution trace.

#### Solving system of equations for register one

The polynomial of minimal degree that satisfies these three questions has degree 2, and is given by

#### `\mathcal{E}_{B,j}(x) = b_2x^2 + b_1x + b_0`

To determine the coefficient we get `x` from the previous equations and use it in the polynomial

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000010\rangle^2 + b_1\langle0000000000000010\rangle + b_0) = a`

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000011\rangle^2 + b_1\langle0000000000000011\rangle + b_0) = b`

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000001\rangle^2 + b_1\langle0000000000000001\rangle + b_0) = a + b`

`=`

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000100\rangle + b_1\langle0000000000000010\rangle + b_0) = a`

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000101\rangle^2 + b_1\langle0000000000000011\rangle + b_0) = b`

##### `\mathcal{E}_{B,1}(b_2\langle0000000000000001\rangle + b_1\langle0000000000000001\rangle + b_0) = a + b`

#### Solving system of equations for register one

To easily read the coeffients, we can write with base 10 numbers

##### `4b_2 + 2b_1 + b_0 = a`

##### `5b_2 + 3b_1 + b_0 = b`

##### `b_2 + b_1 + b_0 = a + b`

Our goal now is to compute the `b'_j` terms, which we can do with Gaussian elimination. We will rewrite the system of equations as an augmented matrix:

```
\begin{matrix}
4 & 2 & 1 & | & a\\
5 & 3 & 1 & | & b\\
4 & 2 & 1 & | & a + b\\
\end{matrix}
```

#### `\mathcal{N}`

The set `\mathcal{N}` is used to generate an affine graph, where the directed graph with vertex set `\mathbb{F}` and edge set `\{(x, N(x))\ |\ x \in \mathbb{F}, N \in \mathcal{N}\}`

The affine graph is added to the isntance description via its generating set `\mathcal{N}`. Each column of the algebraic execution trace (each register, tracked over time `T`) is a Reed Solomon codeword of rate `\rho` and the sequence of rates (one rate per register) is also part of the sintance description.

###### `\mathcal{N}=\{(\tau,x),(\tau,tx),(\tau,tx+(t^2+t+1))\}`

###### `=\{(1,x),(1,2x),(1,2x+7),(2,x),(2,2x),(2,2x+7)\}`

#### `\Phi`

The set `\Phi` captures both the boundary and transition constraints of the computation.

```
\Phi_{p}= \left\{ \begin{array}{c}
\frac{x(x-1)}{Z_{H_{0}}(x)}\cdot P(\overline{(1,x)},\overline{(2,x)},\overline{(1,2x)},\overline{(2,2x)}),\\
\frac{1}{Z_{H_{1}}(x)}\cdot P(\overline{(1,x)},\overline{(2,x)},\overline{(1,2x+7)},\overline{(2,2x+7)})
\end{array}\right\}
```

#### Rate factor

The rate factor determines the maximum degree of the Reed-Solomon codes

`\rho_{1} =\frac{2^{k+t'}-deg(Z_{B,1})}{|L|}`
`=\frac{2^{1+2}-3}{512}`
`=\frac{5}{512}`

Since the definition doesn't depend on the register, the rate factor is the same for all registers.
`\rho_{2}    =\rho_{1}`

`\rho_{cmp}    =\frac{1+2^{k+t'+d}}{|L_{cmp}|}`
`=\frac{1+2^{4}}{256}`
`=\frac{17}{256}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)

#### Witness reduction

Witness reduction works by transforming the AIR witness into somewhat random polynomials.
`Q_{j}:\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}\to\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}}`

of degree `deg(Q_{j})<2^{k+t'}=2^{3}=8` such that

#### `Q_{j}(g^{i}\%\xi)=w_{i,j}`
 for all `i\in\{1,2,3\}`

To incorporate some randomness into the system, we have to choose the degree of the `Q`’s to be at least three (because we have 3 evaluation points).

We choose four and make the Ansatz:

`Q_{j}(x)=q_{j,4}x^{4}+q_{j,3}x^{3}+q_{j,2}x^{2}+q_{j,1}x+q_{j,0}`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)

#### Witness reduction

```
\mathbb{W}_{right}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
38638 & | & 62635\\
62635 & | & 25157\\
25157 & | & 38638
\end{array}\right]
```

```
Q_{1}^{right}(2)=38638\\
Q_{1}^{right}(3)=62635\\
Q_{1}^{right}(1)=25157
```

and similar

```
Q_{2}^{right}(2)=62635\\
Q_{2}^{right}(3)=25157\\
Q_{2}^{right}(1)=38638
```

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Witness reduction

We apply the Gaussian elimination:

```
\begin{array}{ccccccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 30723\lambda_{1} & 58374\lambda_{2} & | & 40137 & || & 26217\\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 30723\lambda_{2} & | & 0 & || & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1 & 30722\lambda_{1} & 39940\lambda_{2} & | & 65164 & || & 61575\\
0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda_{1} & 0 & | & 0 & || & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \lambda_{2} & | & 0 & || & 0
\end{array}
```

We have to choose the parameters `\lambda_{1}` and `\lambda_{2}` uniformly random from `\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`, so we just choose `\lambda_{1}=7` and `\lambda_{2}=1234` for `Q_{1}^{right}`, and we can do a similar computation for `Q_{2}^{right}`.

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Witness reduction

So in the end, we get:

`Q_{1}^{right}(x)=52553x^{4}+61918x^{3}+23047x^{2}+7x+1234`

`Q_{2}^{right}(x)=57512x^{4}+1974x^{3}+20701x^{2}+12441x+4532`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Witness reduction

Putting `a = 38638` and `b = 62635` into our `\mathcal{E}_{B,j}`  we get

`\mathcal{E}_{B,j} = 6382x^2 + 31403x`

`\mathcal{E}_{B,j} = 54163x^2 + 17789x`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Witness reduction

Using these Polynomials we can finally define the APR-representation of our witnesses as

`\mathbb{W}_{j}^{APR}:L\to\mathbb{F}_{2^{n}};x\mapsto\frac{Q_{j}(x)-\mathcal{E}_{B,j}(x)}{Z_{B,j}(x)}`

Computing the following

`\mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR,right}(x) = \frac{52553x^{4}+61918x^{3}+17129x^{2}+31404x+1234}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

`\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR,right}(x) = \frac{57512x^{4}+1974x^{3}+33614x^{2}+30180x+4532}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

We know that this is well defined, because the denominator only has roots in `H`, which by definition has no interaction with `L`. If there was an interaction, then the denominator would be zero and this would fail.

#### Witness reduction - fraudulent

```
\mathbb{W}_{wrong}=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
38638 & | & 62635\\
65280 & | & 255\\
43690 & | & 21845
\end{array}\right]
```

`Q_{1}^{wrong}(2)=38638`

`Q_{1}^{wrong}(3)=65280`

`Q_{1}^{wrong}(1)=43690`

and similar

`Q_{2}^{wrong}(2)=62635`

`Q_{2}^{wrong}(3)=255`

`Q_{2}^{wrong}(1)=21845`

-----
## Algebraic Placement and Routing (APR)
---
#### Witness reduction - fraudulent

Performing the similar computation for `Q^{right}`'s we get

`Q_{1}^{wrong}(x)=63914x^{4}+43163x^{3}+62121x^{2}+2353x+3`

`Q_{2}^{wrong}(x)=1283x^{4}+20663x^{3}+20854x^{2}+815x+21176`

`\mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR,wrong}(x) = \frac{63914x^{4}+43163x^{3}+59975x^{2}+29594x+3}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

`\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR,wrong}(x) = \frac{1283x^{4}+20663x^{3}+33509x^{2}+18002x+21176}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

-----
## Reed-Solomon Interlude
---
#### Definition

Mathematically speaking, a Reed-Solomon code is nothing but a linear map `c : V \to W` from a vector space `V` of dimension `m` into a vector space of dimension `n`, such that `n > m` and both vector spaces are over the same field.

Let `\mathbb{F}_{<\rho n}[x]` be the set of all polynomials in the
indetermined `x` with coefficients from `\mathbb{F}`, that have
degree less then `\rho\cdot|S|` where `\rho\in(0,1]`.

Then the Reed Solomon code is the map

`RS:\mathbb{F}_{<\rho n}[x]\to\mathbb{F}^{n};f\mapsto(f(s_{1}),...,f(s_{n})`

-----
## Reed-Solomon Interlude
---
#### Checking the Reed-Solomon property

The APR witnesses are Reed-Solomon codes from

`RS[\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}, L, \frac{5}{512}]`

if and only if they are derived form a correct execution trace.

Additionally, we can substitute the APR witnesses into the polynomials from `\Phi` and get functions which are Reed-Solomon codes from

`RS[\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}, L_{cmp}, \frac{17}{256}]`

if and only if they are derived form a correct execution trace.

For the rest of the talk, we will only focus on the focus regarding Reed-Solomon codes of `L`.

-----
## Reed-Solomon Interlude
---
#### Checking the Reed-Solomon property

To see that `APR^{right}` is a real Reed-Solomon code and `APR^{wrong}` is not, we can execute the actual polynomial division of the numerator and denominator of the APR witnesses to check.

**NOTE:** In a real world setting, this would be very expensive and is not part of the verification.

This is why we target FRI as the final step, but for our example its useful to see how the wrong execution trace differs from the correct one.

-----
## Reed-Solomon Interlude
---
#### Checking the Reed-Solomon property

`\mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR,right}(x) = 52553x+61918`

`\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR,right}(x) = 57512x+1974`

`\mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR,wrong}(x) = 63914x+43163+\frac{9735x^{2}+6214x+63150}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

`\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR,wrong}(x) = 1283x+20663+\frac{39404x^{2}+58716x+48907}{x^{3}+7x+6}`

So we see that the actual witnesses are polynomials, and that their degree is sufficiently small (given the rate factor `\frac{5}{512}`).

The fraudulent witnesses are not polynomials at all, they are rational functions.

-----
## Reed Solomon Proximity Testing (RPT)
---
![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-RPT.svg)

We now need a process to check that our APR witness is an actual Reed-Solomon code, in an efficient way.

We do this with algebraic linking interactive oracle proof (ALI).

**NOTE:** we will only compute the polynomial `f^{(0)}` but not `g^{(0)}`.

-----
## Reed Solomon Proximity Testing (RPT)
---
#### Algebraic linking IOP (ALI)

The result of the reductions are the pairs in the `R_{APR}`. The ALI phase uses a 1-round IOP to reduce the problem to a pair of binary RS proximity testing problems.

The first step is to sample a Reed-Solomon code from

`f_{mask}\in RS[\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}},\{256,...,767\},\frac{5}{512}]`

and we choose

`f_{mask}(x) =17443x+49`

-----
## Reed Solomon Proximity Testing (RPT)
---
#### Algebraic linking IOP (ALI) - Prover

We begin the interactive protocol with the prover sending

#### `\{ \mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR}(x),\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR}(x),17443x+49\}`

to the verifier.


-----
## Reed Solomon Proximity Testing (RPT)
---
#### Algebraic linking IOP (ALI) - Verifier

The verifier then chooses 4 random numbers.

##### `r_{1,0}^{right} =34451`

##### `r_{1,1}^{right} =34571`

##### `r_{2,0}^{right} =12567`

##### `r_{2,1}^{right} =55632`

These values are used to compute to the starting point of the FRI step:

##### `f^{(0)}(x) = f_{mask}(x)`

##### `+(r_{1,0}+r_{1,1}\cdot x^{|L|(\rho_{max}-\rho_{1})})\mathbb{W}_{1}^{APR,right}(x)`

##### `+(r_{2,0}+r_{2,1}\cdot x^{|L|(\rho_{max}-\rho_{2})})\mathbb{W}_{2}^{APR,right}(x)`

-----
## Reed Solomon Proximity Testing (RPT)
---
#### Algebraic linking IOP (ALI) - Verifier

Substituting the chosen randomness, we get

`f^{(0)}(x) = \frac{29041x^{4}+15755x^{3}+18012x^{2}+34716x+36154}{x^{3}+7x+6}`


The central point of the STARK system is to verify proximity of the function `f^{(0)}: L \to \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}` to the Reed-Solomon code

`RS[\mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}, L, \frac{5}{512}]`.

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
![pipeline-overview](images/pipeline-FRI.svg)

How do we efficiently check the proximity to the Reed-Solomon codes?

One answer is FRI.

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
#### Security Parameter

The FRI protocol is parameterized by an integer, which we choose to be `\eta = 2`.

This implies one additional round of interaction, because the zeroeth step was the ALI setup where `f^{(0)}` was exchanged between prover and verifier.

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
#### The Setup phase

The prover and verifier "agree" on the affine-subspace `L_0 \subset L` of dimension `\eta = 2` given by

`L_{0}^{(0)} = \{\langle00000001000000\lambda_{1}\lambda_{0}\rangle|\lambda_{0},\lambda_{1}\in\{0,1\}\}`

`=\{256,257,258,259\}`

`Zero_{L_{0}^{(0)}}(x)= (x+256)(x+257)(x+258)(x+259)`

`= x^{4}+7x^{2}+6x+28111`

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
#### The Setup phase

We need to compute one more layer, since `\eta = 2`

`L^{(1)} = Zero_{L_{0}^{(0)}}(L^{(0)})`

This is a larger expansion, and will be shown only in the paper.

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
#### The Commit phase

The prover needs some randomness, which is sent by the verifier.

Then the prover can compute the next `f` term from the ALI step like

`f^{(1)}: L^{(1)} \to \mathbb{F}_{2^{16}}`

-----
## Fast RS IOP of proximity (FRI)
---
#### The Query phase

The verifier will randomly choose from the lowest domain `L^{(1)}`
