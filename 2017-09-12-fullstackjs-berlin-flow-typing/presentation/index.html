## What is Flow

- Project is developed at Facebook and [open sourced in 2014](https://code.facebook.com/posts/1505962329687926/flow-a-new-static-type-checker-for-javascript)
- "... a new open-source static type checker for JavaScript. Flow adds static typing to JavaScript to improve developer productivity and code quality."

-----

## What is static typing?
[wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)

"Static type checking is the process of verifying the type safety of a program based on analysis of a program's text (source code). If a program passes a static type checker, then the program is guaranteed to satisfy some set of type safety properties for all possible inputs."

    const doubleIt = (x) => x * 2

    doubleIt(10) // => 20 OK
    doubleIt('10') // => 20 Type coercion
    doubleIt(['10']) // => 20 O RLY?

-----

## What is static typing?
[wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking)

"Without static type checking, even code coverage tests with 100% coverage may be unable to find such type errors. The tests may fail to detect such type errors, because the combination of all places where values are created and all places where a certain value is used must be taken into account."

-----

## Why do we want static typing?
In a statically typed language:

- function inputs and output have a type
- variables have a type
- a type checker can catch certain errors at analysis time based on these types

-----

## Why do we want static typing?

    const greeter = (user) => `Hello ${user}`

    const sadUser = { name: 'Mr. Nope' }
    greeter(sadUser)
      // => "Hello [object Object]"

-----

## Why do we want static typing?

    // @flow
    const greeter = (user: string): string =>
      `Hello ${user}`

    const sadUser: User = { name: 'Mr. Nope' }
    // $ExpectError
    greeter(sadUser)

-----

## Why do we want static typing?

    // @flow
    const greeter = (user: string): string =>
      `Hello ${user}`

    const happyUser: User = { name: 'Ms. Yea' }
    greeter(happyUser.name)

-----

## Why do we want static typing?

* we are always putting values into containers called variables
* statically typed variables give us a container with a type annotation along with the value
* dynamically typed variables are containers that have a value and no other properties

-----

## JavaScript is a dynamically typed language

- function inputs and output as well as variables have NO type annotations
- type errors can only be found by the interpreter at runtime, when an expression is being evaluated

## Javascript is a weakly typed language
[it coerces types leading to some "wat" moments]((https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat))

    console.log({} + {}) // ?

## The Internet is awesome

- deploying clients on the web is great: no App Store, as many subdomains as you want, fast update cycles, and CDNs for when things don't change often
- and it powered by Javascript: large and maturing ecosystem of libraries and tooling

-----

## Why to use Flow
- we are writing software professionaly and JavaScript alone does not give enough confidence to ship software
- tools like eslint provide some safety guarantees, as well as code quality aspects (no-unused-vars, no-shadow names, prefer-const)
- tools like prettier automate formatting for style choices

-----

## Why to use Flow

- working in a project requires a high level of awareness (even green field projects become featureful)
- collaborators on projects come and go (on vacation, having children, go to other projects)
- takes pressure off code review so things like ethos of the project and design choices can be more visible

-----

## Why to use Flow

- adding a tool that allows automated type checking while not forcing us to dramatically change the libraries or code style that we already like to use

-----

## Primitive Types

- `boolean` => true
- `number` => 42, NaN, Infinity
- `string` => "probably unicode support ðŸŽ‰"
- `null`
- `void` (better known as `undefined`)
